He played college football at Alabama, where he was awarded the Fred Biletnikoff Award as the nation's best wide receiver as a sophomore in 2018, and was drafted by the Broncos with the 15th overall pick of the 2020 NFL Draft. Early years Jeudy attended Deerfield Beach High School in Deerfield Beach, Florida, where he played high school football. As a high school senior in 2016, he had 76 receptions for 1,054 yards and 15 touchdowns. Jeudy was rated as a five star recruit, the third highest rated wide receiver in the country and 21st highest rated recruit overall by the 247Sports Composite. He committed to the University of Alabama to play college football on July 28, 2016. College career Freshman year: 2017 Jeudy enrolled early at Alabama and participated in spring practice for the 2017 season. He was named the MVP of Alabama's A-Day spring game after catching five passes for 134 yards and two touchdowns. Jeudy caught his first career pass in Alabama's second game of the season against Fresno State. In total, Jeudy amassed 14 receptions for 264 yards and two touchdowns during his true freshman season. Sophomore year: 2018 During the spring before his sophomore season in 2018, Jeudy underwent surgery for a meniscus injury which led him to miss part of spring practice. He fully recovered in time for fall camp, saying \"I feel great, actually. I forgot I got injured to be real.\" Jeudy was named third-team preseason All-SEC at SEC Media Days. Jeudy caught six touchdown passes in Alabama's first three games of the 2018 season, including a 136-yard, two-touchdown performance against Ole Miss. He had 135 yards and two touchdowns against Arkansas on October 6, and the next week set a career high with 147 yards and a touchdown against Missouri. He had 139 yards and a touchdown in Alabama's loss to Clemson in the 2019 College Football Playoff National Championship. Jeudy was named a consensus first-team All-American and first-team All-SEC. He was awarded the Fred Biletnikoff Award as the nation's best wide receiver. His 14 receiving touchdowns led the conference and was tied for third nationally, and his 1,315 receiving yards were second in the conference behind Ole Miss's A. J. Brown. Junior year: 2019 Jeudy was a unanimous pre-season All-American heading into his junior year, and a favorite to repeat as the Biletnikoff Award winner. Numerous publications named him among the best returning players in the country, and he was listed on several Heisman Trophy watchlists. Jeudy was the Crimson Tide's leading receiver in each of their first two games, finishing with 137 yards and a touchdown in the season opener against Duke, and 103 yards and three touchdowns against New Mexico State the following week. Jeudy eclipsed 100 yards in only two more games during the regular season, in part due to the season-ending injury of quarterback Tua Tagovailoa. He finished the regular season with 959 yards receiving and 9 touchdowns and was again named first-team All-SEC. He capped off his junior season with six receptions for 204 yards and a touchdown in the Crimson Tide's win over Michigan in the Citrus Bowl. In January 2020, Jeudy announced he would forgo his senior season by entering the 2020 NFL Draft.",

He played college football for Houston, where he became the NCAA's all-time leader in total passing yards, touchdowns, and completions. In the 2008 college football season, Keenum ranked first nationally in total offense and second in total passing yards. During the 2011 season, Keenum became the Football Bowl Subdivision's all-time leader in total offense, as well as the all-time leader in total passing yards and touchdown passes by a college quarterback. As a result of his on-field contributions to Houston's success, Keenum was named to several All-American lists. He is the only quarterback in Division I FBS football history to have passed for more than 5,000 yards in each of three seasons, and the only college player to reach the 20,000-yards plateau. After being signed by the Houston Texans as an undrafted free agent in 2012, Keenum threw for 1,760 yards and nine touchdowns in the eight games he started for the Texans in 2013 before being waived prior to the 2014 season. He was then signed to the St. Louis Rams' practice squad and then re-signed with the Texans later in 2014. In 2015, the Rams (who later relocated to Los Angeles) traded a draft pick to the Texans for Keenum, where he played until signing as a free agent with the Minnesota Vikings in 2017. After starter Sam Bradford was injured, Keenum came in and had a career year, setting highs in starts, passing yards, completions, and touchdowns. He led the Vikings to a 13-win regular season, followed by a last-second win, known as the Minneapolis Miracle, over the New Orleans Saints in the playoffs. Following that, Keenum played for the Denver Broncos, the Washington Redskins, Cleveland Browns, and Buffalo Bills. He is known for being a journeyman quarterback by having played for seven different NFL teams.",

In the bowl game, Barnett recorded six total tackles and a sack, which was the record-breaker. After the season, Barnett decided to forgo his senior year and enter the 2017 NFL Draft. Professional career Coming out of Tennessee, Barnett was projected to be a first round pick by the majority of NFL draft experts and scouts. He received an invitation to the NFL Combine, but opted to skip the bench press, short shuttle, and three-cone drill due to a stomach bug. On March 31, 2017, Barnett participated at Tennessee's pro day, along with Joshua Dobbs, Alvin Kamara, Cameron Sutton, Jalen Reeves-Maybin, Josh Malone, Jason Croom, former Saint's wide receiver Robert Meachem, and 17 other prospects. Around 100 scouts and team representatives from all 32 NFL teams attended to watch Barnett perform all of the combine and positional drills. He was ranked the fourth best defensive end by ESPN and was ranked the third best defensive end prospect by Sports Illustrated, NFL media analyst Bucky Brooks, NFLDraftScout.com, and Pro Football Focus. The Philadelphia Eagles selected Barnett in the first round (14th overall) of the 2017 NFL Draft. He was the third defensive end to be selected, behind Myles Garrett (1st overall, Browns) and Solomon Thomas (3rd overall, 49ers). Barnett was the first of six Tennessee Volunteers to be selected in the 2017 NFL Draft. On June 2, 2017, the Philadelphia Eagles signed Barnett to a fully guaranteed four-year, $12.85 million contract with a signing bonus of $7.48 million. He competed with Brandon Graham, Chris Long, Vinny Curry, and Steven Means throughout training camp for a job as a starting defensive end. Head coach Doug Pederson named him the backup right defensive end behind veteran Vinny Curry to start the regular season. He made his professional regular season debut during the Philadelphia Eagles' season-opener again the Washington Redskins and recorded two solo tackles in a 30-17 victory. In Week 6, Barnett collected two solo tackles and was credited with half a sack on Carolina Panthers' quarterback Cam Newton during a 28–23 victory. His sack on Cam Newton marked the first one of his career. In Week 7, against the Washington Redskins, he recorded three tackles and had his first career game with multiple sacks with two. In Week 11, against the Dallas Cowboys, he recorded another two-sack game in the 37–9 victory. In Week 16, on Christmas Day, he recorded his first career touchdown on a 23-yard fumble recovery in the 19–10 victory over the Oakland Raiders. In Super Bowl 52, he recovered a crucial fumble after Tom Brady was stripped of the ball after a sack by Brandon Graham. The Eagles would go on to win 41-33. On November 27, 2023, Barnett was claimed off waivers by the Houston Texans.  Barnett re-signed with the Texans on April 1, 2024.",
