He played college football at Alabama, where he was awarded the Fred Biletnikoff Award as the nation's best wide receiver as a sophomore in 2018, and was drafted by the Broncos with the 15th overall pick of the 2020 NFL Draft. Early years Jeudy attended Deerfield Beach High School in Deerfield Beach, Florida, where he played high school football. As a high school senior in 2016, he had 76 receptions for 1,054 yards and 15 touchdowns. Jeudy was rated as a five star recruit, the third highest rated wide receiver in the country and 21st highest rated recruit overall by the 247Sports Composite. He committed to the University of Alabama to play college football on July 28, 2016. College career Freshman year: 2017 Jeudy enrolled early at Alabama and participated in spring practice for the 2017 season. He was named the MVP of Alabama's A-Day spring game after catching five passes for 134 yards and two touchdowns. Jeudy caught his first career pass in Alabama's second game of the season against Fresno State. In total, Jeudy amassed 14 receptions for 264 yards and two touchdowns during his true freshman season. Sophomore year: 2018 During the spring before his sophomore season in 2018, Jeudy underwent surgery for a meniscus injury which led him to miss part of spring practice. He fully recovered in time for fall camp, saying \"I feel great, actually. I forgot I got injured to be real.\" Jeudy was named third-team preseason All-SEC at SEC Media Days. Jeudy caught six touchdown passes in Alabama's first three games of the 2018 season, including a 136-yard, two-touchdown performance against Ole Miss. He had 135 yards and two touchdowns against Arkansas on October 6, and the next week set a career high with 147 yards and a touchdown against Missouri. He had 139 yards and a touchdown in Alabama's loss to Clemson in the 2019 College Football Playoff National Championship. Jeudy was named a consensus first-team All-American and first-team All-SEC. He was awarded the Fred Biletnikoff Award as the nation's best wide receiver. His 14 receiving touchdowns led the conference and was tied for third nationally, and his 1,315 receiving yards were second in the conference behind Ole Miss's A. J. Brown. Junior year: 2019 Jeudy was a unanimous pre-season All-American heading into his junior year, and a favorite to repeat as the Biletnikoff Award winner. Numerous publications named him among the best returning players in the country, and he was listed on several Heisman Trophy watchlists. Jeudy was the Crimson Tide's leading receiver in each of their first two games, finishing with 137 yards and a touchdown in the season opener against Duke, and 103 yards and three touchdowns against New Mexico State the following week. Jeudy eclipsed 100 yards in only two more games during the regular season, in part due to the season-ending injury of quarterback Tua Tagovailoa. He finished the regular season with 959 yards receiving and 9 touchdowns and was again named first-team All-SEC. He capped off his junior season with six receptions for 204 yards and a touchdown in the Crimson Tide's win over Michigan in the Citrus Bowl. In January 2020, Jeudy announced he would forgo his senior season by entering the 2020 NFL Draft.",

He played college football for Houston, where he became the NCAA's all-time leader in total passing yards, touchdowns, and completions. In the 2008 college football season, Keenum ranked first nationally in total offense and second in total passing yards. During the 2011 season, Keenum became the Football Bowl Subdivision's all-time leader in total offense, as well as the all-time leader in total passing yards and touchdown passes by a college quarterback. As a result of his on-field contributions to Houston's success, Keenum was named to several All-American lists. He is the only quarterback in Division I FBS football history to have passed for more than 5,000 yards in each of three seasons, and the only college player to reach the 20,000-yards plateau. After being signed by the Houston Texans as an undrafted free agent in 2012, Keenum threw for 1,760 yards and nine touchdowns in the eight games he started for the Texans in 2013 before being waived prior to the 2014 season. He was then signed to the St. Louis Rams' practice squad and then re-signed with the Texans later in 2014. In 2015, the Rams (who later relocated to Los Angeles) traded a draft pick to the Texans for Keenum, where he played until signing as a free agent with the Minnesota Vikings in 2017. After starter Sam Bradford was injured, Keenum came in and had a career year, setting highs in starts, passing yards, completions, and touchdowns. He led the Vikings to a 13-win regular season, followed by a last-second win, known as the Minneapolis Miracle, over the New Orleans Saints in the playoffs. Following that, Keenum played for the Denver Broncos, the Washington Redskins, Cleveland Browns, and Buffalo Bills. He is known for being a journeyman quarterback by having played for seven different NFL teams.",

In the bowl game, Barnett recorded six total tackles and a sack, which was the record-breaker. After the season, Barnett decided to forgo his senior year and enter the 2017 NFL Draft. Professional career Coming out of Tennessee, Barnett was projected to be a first round pick by the majority of NFL draft experts and scouts. He received an invitation to the NFL Combine, but opted to skip the bench press, short shuttle, and three-cone drill due to a stomach bug. On March 31, 2017, Barnett participated at Tennessee's pro day, along with Joshua Dobbs, Alvin Kamara, Cameron Sutton, Jalen Reeves-Maybin, Josh Malone, Jason Croom, former Saint's wide receiver Robert Meachem, and 17 other prospects. Around 100 scouts and team representatives from all 32 NFL teams attended to watch Barnett perform all of the combine and positional drills. He was ranked the fourth best defensive end by ESPN and was ranked the third best defensive end prospect by Sports Illustrated, NFL media analyst Bucky Brooks, NFLDraftScout.com, and Pro Football Focus. The Philadelphia Eagles selected Barnett in the first round (14th overall) of the 2017 NFL Draft. He was the third defensive end to be selected, behind Myles Garrett (1st overall, Browns) and Solomon Thomas (3rd overall, 49ers). Barnett was the first of six Tennessee Volunteers to be selected in the 2017 NFL Draft. On June 2, 2017, the Philadelphia Eagles signed Barnett to a fully guaranteed four-year, $12.85 million contract with a signing bonus of $7.48 million. He competed with Brandon Graham, Chris Long, Vinny Curry, and Steven Means throughout training camp for a job as a starting defensive end. Head coach Doug Pederson named him the backup right defensive end behind veteran Vinny Curry to start the regular season. He made his professional regular season debut during the Philadelphia Eagles' season-opener again the Washington Redskins and recorded two solo tackles in a 30-17 victory. In Week 6, Barnett collected two solo tackles and was credited with half a sack on Carolina Panthers' quarterback Cam Newton during a 28–23 victory.

In Week 11, against the Dallas Cowboys, he recorded another two-sack game in the 37–9 victory. In Week 16, on Christmas Day, he recorded his first career touchdown on a 23-yard fumble recovery in the 19–10 victory over the Oakland Raiders. In Super Bowl 52, he recovered a crucial fumble after Tom Brady was stripped of the ball after a sack by Brandon Graham. The Eagles would go on to win 41-33. On November 27, 2023, Barnett was claimed off waivers by the Houston Texans.  Barnett re-signed with the Texans on April 1, 2024.",

He played college football for the University of Oregon and received All-American honors. He was drafted by the Carolina Panthers in the sixth round of the 2013 NFL Draft. Barner has also played for the Los Angeles Chargers. High school career Barner attended Notre Dame High School in Riverside, California, where he played for the Notre Dame Titans high school football team.

A native of Southern California, Barner chose to attend the University of Oregon and play for head coach Chip Kelly's Oregon Ducks football team. He was ranked by Rivals as the 38th best running back prospect in the country, as well as the 86th overall prospect from the state of California Barner chose UO over scholarship offers from Arizona State and UTEP. Barner is the first Oregon Duck since 1965 who has scored touchdowns rushing, receiving, and from punt and kickoff returns. He suffered a career-threatening concussion after a helmet-to-helmet hit in 2010.

On November 4, 2014, he was signed to the Philadelphia Eagles' practice squad. During the 2015 preseason, Barner attempted to make the roster behind 3 former NFL starters, DeMarco Murray, Ryan Matthews and Darren Sproles.

High school career Heinicke played football under head coach Kevin Reach at Collins Hill High School in Lawrenceville, Georgia, where he was an all-state selection as a junior after guiding Collins Hill to a 10–4 record and a trip to the Class AAAAA semi-finals. As a senior, Heinicke was named the Old Spice National Player of the Year in the state of Georgia. The award is presented annually to 50 high school varsity football athletes. He was also the Gwinnett Daily Post's Offensive Player of the Year after his record season when he threw for 4,218 yards, the second most in state history, and 44 touchdowns, which is the third-best ever in Georgia, setting Gwinnett County single-season records for passing yards and touchdowns. He threw over 300 yards in nine games and also ran for 354 yards on 77 carries along with a pair of touchdowns. Following his senior season, Heinicke was invited to play at the North/South All-Star Football Classic, where he collected 254 yards and three touchdowns en route to MVP honors after helping the North to a 22–0 victory over the South. He appeared on the reality TV show The Ride, which featured high school quarterbacks competing for a spot in the U.S. Army All-American Bowl.",

      "description": "James Joseph Harbaugh (/ˈhɑːrbɔː/; born December 23, 1963) is an American football coach and former quarterback, who is the current head football coach of the Michigan Wolverines. He played college football at Michigan from 1983 to 1986. He played in the National Football League (NFL) for 14 seasons from 1987 to 2000 with his longest tenure as a player with the Chicago Bears. He served as the head coach of the San Diego Toreros (2004–2006), the Stanford Cardinal (2007–2010), and the NFL's San Francisco 49ers (2011–2014).  In 2015, Harbaugh returned to his alma mater: University of Michigan. Harbaugh was born in Toledo, Ohio. His father, Jack Harbaugh, was a football coach, and the family lived in Ohio, Kentucky, Iowa, Michigan, and California. He attended high school in Ann Arbor, Michigan and Palo Alto, California, when his father was an assistant coach at Michigan and Stanford, respectively. After graduation from high school in Palo Alto in 1982, Harbaugh returned to Ann Arbor and enrolled at the University of Michigan and played quarterback for the Wolverines, starting for three seasons. As a fifth-year senior in 1986, he led Michigan to the 1987 Rose Bowl and was a Heisman Trophy finalist, finishing third. The Chicago Bears selected Harbaugh in the first round of the 1987 NFL Draft. He played 14 years as a quarterback in the NFL, with Chicago from 1987 to 1993, the Indianapolis Colts from 1994 to 1997, the Baltimore Ravens in 1998, and the San Diego Chargers in 1999 to 2000. He first became a regular starting quarterback in 1990 with Chicago. In 1995 with Indianapolis, he led the Colts to the AFC Championship Game, was selected to the Pro Bowl and was honored as NFL Comeback Player of the Year. From 1994 to 2001, while still playing in the NFL, Harbaugh was an unpaid assistant coach at Western Kentucky University, where his father Jack was head coach. In 2002, he returned to the NFL as the quarterbacks coach for the Oakland Raiders. Harbaugh returned to the college ranks in 2004 as the head coach at the University of San Diego. After leading San Diego to consecutive Pioneer League championships in 2005 and 2006, he moved to Stanford in 2007, where he led the Cardinal to two bowl berths in four seasons, including a win in the 2011 Orange Bowl. Immediately afterward, Harbaugh signed a five-year deal as head coach of the NFL's San Francisco 49ers, where he led the team to the NFC Championship game in each of his first three seasons after the franchise missed the playoffs for eight consecutive seasons beforehand. He and his older brother, Baltimore Ravens coach John Harbaugh, became the first pair of brothers to serve as head coaches in NFL history. Their teams played in a Thanksgiving Classic game in 2011 and in Super Bowl XLVII at the end of the 2012 season.",

Haskins placed second in the high jump at the 2017 MSHSAA Class 5 State Championship, clearing 6' 7\". As a senior, he led the basketball team in blocks and steals while averaging 8.1 points per game. As a junior on the football team, Haskins had 242 carries, 1,509 yards, and 19 rushing touchdowns to go along with 2 receiving touchdowns and one passing touchdown. He added 12 sacks and a fumble recovery as a defensive end. As a senior, he had 255 carries, 2,197 yards, and 31 rushing touchdowns with 2 receiving touchdowns. He also contributed on defense with 9 sacks and two fumble recoveries, one of which he returned for a 50-yard touchdown. Haskins was lightly recruited by Power Five football programs. He ran a 4.74 second 40-yard dash in high school, and his speed could be a reason for his under-rating. Said Haskins' high school assistant coach Tyler Wasson, \"There was a 1-AA team that would e-mail us, 'Well, he doesn't fit our system. He's not fast enough.'\" When Michigan was recruiting Haskins, he was the nation's 82nd best running back and well outside the top 1,000 recruits in the class. Haskins committed to Michigan on October 29, 2017, as a three-star running back. He ended the recruitment cycle as the no. 975 overall recruit after he signed with Michigan.",

Rodgers played college football for the California Golden Bears, where he set several career passing records, including lowest single-season and career interception rates. He was selected in the first round of the 2005 NFL Draft by the Packers. After backing up Brett Favre for the first three years of his NFL career, Rodgers became the Packers' starting quarterback in 2008. In 2010 he led them to a victory in Super Bowl XLV over the Pittsburgh Steelers, earning the Super Bowl MVP. He was named Associated Press Athlete of the Year in 2011, and was voted league MVP by the Associated Press for the 2011 and 2014 NFL seasons. Rodgers has led the NFL three times in touchdown-to-interception ratio (2011, 2012, 2014); twice in passer rating (2011, 2012), touchdown passing percentage (2011, 2012), and lowest passing interception percentage (2009, 2014); and once in touchdown passes (2016) and yards per attempt (2011). Rodgers is the NFL's all-time regular season career passer rating leader and is one of two quarterbacks to have a regular season career passer rating of over 100. Rodgers is fifth all-time in postseason career passer rating, has the best touchdown-to-interception ratio in NFL history at 4.13, holds the league's lowest career interception percentage at 1.6 percent and the highest single-season passer rating record of 122.5. Due to the fact that Rodgers is the NFL's all-time regular season career passer rating leader, and his overall high level of play, Rodgers is considered by some sportscasters and players to be one of the greatest quarterbacks of all time.",

Recruiting profile Despite his success in high school, Funk was only a moderately-rated prospect, earning two-star ratings from ESPN and Rivals.com and three-star ratings from 247Sports.com and Scout.com. Despite this, he received scholarship offers from the three service academies (Army, Navy, and Air Force) Ivy League schools Harvard, Yale, and Penn, Group of Five schools Ohio, Old Dominion, and Charlotte, Football Championship Subdivision schools Towson and Bucknell, and Big Ten schools Wisconsin and his eventual destination Maryland. Though recruiters were concerned about Funk's speed, his strength and versatility on defense made him an intriguing option (Funk also played safety in high school), and he was recruited by at least one school as a linebacker. However, after receiving his offer from Maryland, Funk quickly committed to his hometown school, where he was the first commit for then-interim head coach Mike Locksley.",

      "description": "Zachary Adam Ertz (born November 10, 1990) is an American football tight end for the Philadelphia Eagles of the National Football League (NFL). He was drafted by the Eagles in the second round of the 2013 NFL draft. He played college football at Stanford, where he was recognized as a unanimous All-American. Early years Ertz was born in Orange, California. He grew up as the oldest of four children. His father played for the Lehigh University football team from 1981 to 1984. Ertz played high school football and basketball at Monte Vista High School in Danville, California. As a senior, he had 56 receptions, 756 receiving yards, and 14 receiving touchdowns for the football team and was named to the All-East Bay Athletic League first team. College career Ertz attended Stanford University, where he played for the Stanford Cardinal football team from 2009 to 2012. He redshirted the 2009 season. In 2010, he played 13 games and had 16 catches for 190 yards and five touchdowns. He had two receptions, including a touchdown, in the Orange Bowl that year. Ertz had 27 receptions, 343 receiving yards, and four receiving touchdowns in 2011, despite missing three games due to a knee injury. In the Fiesta Bowl, he had four catches and one touchdown. The following season, as a junior, Ertz had 69 catches, 898 receiving yards, and six touchdowns. He had three catches for 61 yards in the Rose Bowl. His 898 receiving yards was the most by an FBS tight end that season. He was a consensus All-American, a finalist for the Mackey Award, and an All-Pac-12 first team selection. After the 2012 season, Ertz announced that he would enter the NFL Draft. The Philadelphia Eagles selected Ertz in the second round, with the 35th overall pick, of the 2013 NFL Draft. He was the second tight end drafted behind Tyler Eifert, but ahead of pro-bowlers Travis Kelce and Jordan Reed and fellow Stanford teammate Levine Toilolo. The Eagles signed him to a rookie contract of undisclosed terms on May 9, 2013. Paired with veteran Brent Celek, Ertz caught a pass in 14 of the 16 games that season and finished fifth on the team with 469 receiving yards and four touchdowns his rookie season. Ertz became the primary receiving tight end in 2014 and improved to 702 yards, third on the team. In the penultimate game he had a career best 15 receptions for 115 yards. The last two games of 2015 he had back-to-back 100 yard games including a career-best 152 against the Giants. He finished second on the team with 75 receptions for 853 yards. On January 25, 2016, the Eagles signed Ertz to a five-year, $42 million extension. Following the pattern, his best game of the 2016 was the last with 13 receptions for 139 yards and two touchdowns against the Dallas Cowboys. Despite missing two games, he had 78 receptions for 816 yards and four touchdowns, leading the Eagles in all three categories. Ertz began his breakout 2017 season well, with eight receptions for 93 yards in Week 1, and five receptions for 97 yards in Week 2. After Week 5, he was tied for third in the NFL in receptions. In week 6, he had only two receptions but both were touchdowns, already tying his career best with four on the season. Through Week 7, Ertz led all NFL tight ends in receptions, yards, and touchdowns. After another touchdown against San Francisco, Ertz fell off the pace in Weeks 8-10 with a hamstring injury,, bye-week, and limited duty (season-low two receptions for eight yards) in a Week 10 return. By contrast, in Week 11 Ertz became the first Eagle in 2017 with 100+ yards receiving (103) on a season-high 10 receptions and a seventh touchdown in a 31-3 drubbing of Chicago. On December 19, 2017, Ertz was named to his first Pro Bowl. However, Ertz could not play in the Pro Bowl because of his team advancing to Super Bowl LII. In the Super Bowl, Ertz caught 7 passes for 67 yards plus a go-ahead touchdown late in the fourth quarter. The Eagles won 41-33 over the New England Patriots, giving the Eagles their first championship in franchise history. Personal life Ertz is a Christian. He is married to professional soccer player Julie Johnston Ertz, starting center back on the U.S. Women's National Team; they met in 2012 at a Stanford baseball game. On February 26, 2016, Ertz proposed to Johnston at Klein Field, the Stanford University baseball stadium where they first met. They married on March 26, 2017, in Goleta, California. Julie and Zach Ertz were featured in ESPN The Magazine's Body Issue 2017.",
